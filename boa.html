		<p class="tekst">Boa constrictor, also called the red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a species of large, non-venomous, heavy-bodied snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity.
			The boa constrictor is a member of the family Boidae, found in tropical South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. A staple of private collections and public
			displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive. Nine subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial. This article focuses on
			the species Boa constrictor as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B.C.Constrictor (red-tailed boa).

		<h1 class="naslov">Size and weight</h1>
		<p class="tekst">The boa constrictor is a large snake, although it is only modestly sized in comparison to other large snakes, such as the reticulated python, Burmese python, or the
		occasionally sympatric green anaconda, and can reach lengths from 0.91 to 3.96 m depending on the locality and the availability of suitable prey. Clear sexual
		dimorphism is seen in the species, with females generally being larger in both length and girth than males. The usual size of mature female boas is between 2.1 and 3.0 m 
		whereas males are between 1.8 and 2.4 m. Females commonly exceed 3.0 m, particularly in captivity, where lengths up to 3.7 m or even 4.3 m can be seen. The largest 
		documentednon-stretched dry skin is deposited at Zoologische Staatssammlung München (ZSM 4961/2012) and measures 4.45 m without head. A report of a boa constrictor growing up 
		to 5.6 m was later found to be a misidentified green anaconda.

		<h1 class="naslov">Distribution and habitat</h1>
		<p class="tekst">Depending on the subspecies, Boa constrictor can be found through South America north of 35°S (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, 
		French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Argentina), and many other islands along the coasts of South America. An introduced population exists in extreme southern 
		Florida, and a small population on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands now appears to be reproducing in the wild. The type locality given is "Indiis" – a mistake, 
		according to Peters and Orejas-Miranda (1970). B. Constrictor flourishes in a wide variety of environmental conditions, from tropical rainforests to arid 
		semidesert country. However, it prefers to live in rainforest due to the humidity and temperature, natural cover from predators, and vast amount of potential prey. 
		It is commonly found in or along rivers and streams, as it is a very capable swimmer. Boa constrictors also occupy the burrows of medium-sized mammals, where they can hide
		from potential predators.

		<h1 class="naslov">Hunting and diet</h1>
		<p class="tekst">Although boas are carnivores, they still require variety in their diet to get the full spectrum of vitamins and minerals that their bodies need to stay healthy. 
		After all, it’s not like they only eat rats in the wild. Wild boas are very opportunistic eaters, and captive boas are well known for eating just about anything you put into front 
		of their face like rats, mice, young rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, chickens, quails. Most boa keepers feed their snakes frozen-thawed items only, and the snakes do very well on this 
		diet. Live prey are notorious for injuring captive snakes, sometimes fatally, by biting them to death if snake isn't hungry.
